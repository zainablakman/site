  <h2 class="title">3. Sacrifice for Success</h2> 
 
  <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog4-1.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
  <p style="text-align:justify"> There will always be times when we feel worthless, with no direction in life and no beneficial consequence from whatever endeavor we do. It appears like we are not progressing and that we are stuck in a pointless life. We feel useless and worthless as if everything we intended has failed. We simply feel and observe that everything that happens is bad.</p>  
  <p style="text-align:justify"> It erodes our self-esteem, confidence, courage, and desire to battle. This is a typical predicament, and we must learn how to cope with it. Sometimes we don't know that the more we dwell on all the crappy things that are happening, the closer we get to killing ourselves. We are restraining ourselves from improving, from seizing all possibilities, and from starting up our lives.</p>  
  <p style="text-align:justify"> We didn't understand we were squandering our time and opportunities to pursue our life goals. We squander our time asking the same questions over and over again: "Why am I not successful?" "Why am I like this?" We must learn to perceive and appreciate the good aspects of difficulties. We should also remember that if we want to be successful, we must make some sacrifices.</p>   
  <p style="text-align:justify">  This is why few individuals are successful in life since the majority are afraid to make sacrifices for the sake of success. Let us not be perplexed; instead, let us go to work. Be optimistic all of the time and BE PATIENT; this will not be easy, but patience will help you get through it. Begin your life with good vibes and you will be one of the successful someday.</p>

  <h2 class="title">2. Are You Ready to Accept?</h2>  
  
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog3-1.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
    <p style="text-align:justify"> Sometimes in life, everything seems tough to overcome, as if nothing positive would happen in any plan we make, and our efforts and days are just screwed up. But when that day occurs, we must recall this great verse from the Holy Qur'an.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:justify"> According to the Tafseer of this verse, Allah wants us to know that when all the doors of the world of means are sealed for us and we are helpless in any way, the only one who can unlock the lock of difficulties, bring the light of hope into the hearts, and open the doors of mercy to the distressed ones is His Pure Essence, Allah Ta'ala, and no one else. </p> 
    <p style="text-align:justify"> This serves as a reminder to us that the more intense our lives get, the more we must deepen our faith and intensify our devotion to Him. This is what we were deprived of in this life. We had lost contact with Allah. When we are depressed, have nothing, have failed, and are heartbroken, we do not call Allah, but rather someone else.</p> 
    <p style="text-align:justify"> We keep our distance from Him and the prayers. We sobbed in front of others, but we couldn't grieve in front of Allah and admit what had transpired. We have weakened our faith and dependence on Allah. We should remember that if we offer our hearts to Allah, He will never laugh at us, He will never condemn us, He will never degrade or criticize us, but He will instead send the light of hope into our souls, which are imprisoned among the darkness of our misdeeds and mistakes. He is willing to forgive us and purify our souls, but <b><i>WE ARE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT IT.</b></i>
</p> 
    <p style="text-align:justify"> We must humble ourselves in front of Allah. Be modest in all ways and truthful about whatever we have in our hearts, for Allah is all-Seeing and all-Hearing, whether we conceal it or not. There is nothing we can conceal in this world, but He only wants to hear everything from us to humble us and remind us that He is our God, our Creator, to whom we must entirely submit. Accept Allah's guidance today and be free of adversity.</p>

    <h2 class="title">1. The Best Way to Promote Islam</h2>
    
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog1.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
    <p style="text-align:justify">One of the best way to promote Islam to our non-muslim brothers and sisters is to show the beauty of Islamic morality(Akhlaq). Our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ propagate Islam through the beauty of Akhlaq. He never force anyone to embrace Islam but rather, through his akhlaq and his manner in introducing Islam, he made to invite many countries to love  and embrace Islam, that is why Allah says in the Holy Qur'an in Surah Al-Qalam, verse 4:</p>
    
    <p> وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ۝</p>
    <p>"And most surely you conform (yourself) to sublime morality."</p>
     
    <p style="text-align:justify">Our religion was designed with the jewel of Akhlaq. Everything we do whether it is ibadah, socialization, communication,  socio-political act, and so on, it has to be done with good morality or in a good manner. Unfortunately, today different religions, nations and denominations  are divided because of the wrong manners and ways of preaching the religion which causing violence, terrorism and even murder.  Everyone wants to  dominate each other.They became stereotype propagator where they don't listen and they don't consider other people's belief. They focus on the differences and this is the reason why we buried the unity we are longing for which is suposed to be we are building in our community. We became prejudice not knowing that instead of inviting them to Islam, we tend to push them away because of showing the wrong image of Akhlaq. </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">The reason why Akhlaq is the best way to promote Islam is because it establish unity among different religions. In Islam we have 'Charity' which other religion does, we have the concept of Love, Respect, Understanding,Acceptance and Consideration. Every religion have their own concept of morality but these concepts are never far from the concept of Islam. We need to discuss the commonalities of every religion rather than pointing out the differences. Interfaith dialogue is good but it should be done in a proper manner. 
 </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">In my poster, it shows the idea that, if both Muslim and non-muslim together share the love, respect, understanding and acceptabce to each other, it will grow the seed of unity in the community. If this idea will be practiced by different religion from different part of the world, it will stregrhen the connection to each other, the commitment, the core value and we will give the justice to each other. Lastly, this is how we begin to build a peaceful and progressive united community but in the end, if we failed to work together as one, if would be difficult to achieve our goal.
