    <h2 class="title"> Depression is a Lonely Place</h2>
    
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog9.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
    <p style="text-align:justify">Mental health is a pertinent topic to consider because it is one of the current concerns that people, particularly young people, are dealing with. Any mental or emotional suffering is not a comical matter, nor is it a little concern that should be ignored.
We must understand that Allah ensures us that He will put us to the test through fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives, and fruits. Nobody is exempted from this. Every one of us will be tested in a certain manner, which is reason enough for us to assist those in need of comfort and those in need of support.
Fear is an unpleasant emotion that may trigger other aspects of our bodies to react negatively, leading to feelings of sadness, anxiety, worry, and depression. However, every emotional and mental distress has a different degree depending on the source of the distress, such as when we lose a loved one, have a broken relationship, or lose one of our valuable possessions.
Lack of understanding, empathy, and sympathy for someone mentally unwell can lead to criticism and invalidation of their feelings and sufferings.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">How are we going to deal with them?</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Let me tell you one thing</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">What we see from the outside does not always tell the whole story. That there is something more mysterious and deeper than what our eyes perceive. It's a disease that consumes every part of you, including your eternal peace, sanity, and reasoning. It makes no difference how beautifully attractive or clever you are; once depression hits you deep within, it altered the way you perceive and understand the people around you.
Depression is a lonely place, and no one understands it better than those who have experienced it. The fact that you are sensible and rational would be tough to overcome once you are immersed in your turmoil, and your sorrows. Some people say â€œpray to God", honestly, they do, and it involves a great deal more than you may expect. Because you don't know what's going on with them, don't assume that people suffering from depression have no faith or have weak convictions.
You'll never want to contemplate or think about how much they weep at night, how much they despise themselves, and how much they feel inferior and depleted in life.
Every day, they battle with their own selves, trying to find ways to reroute their thoughts away from all the negativities lingering inside their minds, but the terrible reality is that when they are alone and have to face their selves again in the corners of their darkest place, the loads are there; piles of sadness and pains.
Their joys, smiles, and laughter are just for a little while. No matter how hard they tried, depression was like knives piercing every inch of them. We must understand that these individuals are fragile, hypersensitive, and hypervigilant. They are afraid to open themselves because they know that criticism and prejudice are like an explosion that is unbearable and could severely affect them.
You will never want to be in that darkest, most lonely place when your life is being consumed.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Depression is a powerful emotion that your mind and body barely handle. It causes your sole existence to become disconnected from reality. You don't want to move or do anything; it's as if you've lost interest in life. People suffering from severe depression are more prone to attempt suicide. When all of their sorrows engulf their mind, body, and soul, they resign their life from that point on. They see nothing but darkness. they feel nothing but hopelessness.
Listen to them, show them that you would like to understand them, and most importantly, give them some time. Those who are depressed are striving to sort out and resolve their troubles, but they require some time. Be there for them and show them some love.
When you sense yourself drifting into depression, talk to your family or friends about your issues and challenges. Don't be frightened. Help yourself to find a way back to reality.
I know the pain you're going through is beyond words, but please help yourself. Don't wait until you're stuck in the deepest abyss for the rest of your life.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Always remember that Allah never puts us through hardships that are beyond our capacity. We must be patient, as Allah says, and "give good tidings to the patient" (2:155)
May Allah heal those who are suffering from depression. In Shaa Allah everything shall pass.
Your mental health is a priority and your happiness is essential.</p>
