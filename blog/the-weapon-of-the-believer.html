    <h2 class="title"> The Weapon of the Believer</h2>
    
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog7.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
    <p style="text-align:justify"> Du'a or supplication has been called the weapon of the believer. It is ultimately obedience to Allah and an expression of one's yearning for God. Every individual should perform this uplifting, powerful, freeing, and transformative act on a consistent basis because it is the most potent and efficient kind of worship a person can perform.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify"> Why do you think it is such a powerful act of worship?</p>	
    <p style="text-align:justify"> This is due to the fact that supplicating to Allah does not necessitate a certain time and place. We can supplicate directly to Allah at any time since it is one means we can express our feelings of connection to Him.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> I'd want to share something noteworthy with you.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> If you observed, in Surah Baqarah:185,</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> هْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًۭى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ ۚ</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> “Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur’an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong)..."</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> Allah acknowledged Ramadhan as a month in which the Qur'an was revealed to humanity as guidance and in the latter verse Baqarah:186,</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> ... I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me...</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> Allah confirmed that He is close and answering to the supplicants who call upon Him truly. That implies Ramadhan is important. This is a month when people are showered with mercy and blessings. As a result, we must take advantage of this month by intensifying our supplications to Allah. We should improve our performance in our duties and obligations, as well as undertake extra deeds such as performing more recommended prayers, Qur'an recitation, charitable giving, feeding the destitute, and so on. Our supplication will bring us closer to Allah, and none of our prayers or supplications will be in vain since Allah hears all we ask for.
With all of Allah's blessings and love, we have more reason to be faithful to Him and trust that whatsoever He decrees will never alter. There is no way to measure all of Allah's favors to us, therefore we should not obey conditionally. Whether our supplications are answered or not, our faith in Allah should not be undermined because Allah is the ultimate planner and knows what is best for us. Everything is timed perfectly by Allah.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> Let me tell you a quick story.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> There was a Muslim lady who had to live far away from her family because of her job. She adores her family, and being so far away from them worries her. She wants to protect them, but the distance prevents her from doing so. She prays every day and cries in her prayers when she finds that a member of her family is ill. She met a close friend one day and told her about her sadness, and her friend's advice shifted her life significantly. Her best friend continues to add that even if she is far away from her family, the best way to protect them is to pray to Allah for them. She said that the more you pray, supplicate, and beg Allah to constantly safeguard your family, the more Allah will do so. She stated that prayers are a form of protection and blessing for your loved ones. If you remember them, their protection and blessings will be conveyed to them through your supplications and prayers. Since that day, she has been supplicating more for her family, and her anguish has subsided. She felt more certain that Allah was constantly watching out for her family.
It is true that supplication is magical. It is something that comforts your heart when you are sad and increases your faith when you are despondent. It gives you hope and confidence in the face of adversity. Therefore, supplication is a powerful weapon for believers since it has the power to transform people's lives.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"> Let us spend some time sitting on our prayer mats and reflecting after we pray; this will help us evaluate ourselves based on all we do. Let us increase our remembrance of Allah, ask for his support, and let us open our hearts and speak openly about our concerns and worries, but most importantly, let us be grateful and contented. Always pray not only for our family but also for our fellow citizens. May Allah deepen our love for Him and our reverence for Him. And may all of our supplications for our own virtue be granted.</p>
