    <h2 class="title"> The Stages of Righteousness</h2>
    
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog10.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
	<p style="text-align:justify">Righteousness is addressed several times in the Qur'an, and there are numerous verses in which Allah encourages us to be among the righteous.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Is it difficult to be a righteous person?</p>    
	<p style="text-align:justify">Well, in this glorious verse in Baqarah:177 or also known as the <b><i>“Verse of Righteousness”</i></b>, Allah introduced us to the phases of righteousness, but first, we must realize that being righteous is more than just performing devotional deeds like prayers. The inner contentment, satisfaction, and happiness that a person experiences when he performs the right thing are referred to as righteousness. We felt peace and tranquility in our hearts when we performed something good and when our deeds were in conformity with Allah's commandments.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">What must we do to be counted among the righteous?</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Let us strive to achieve these three levels of righteousness in order to become one of them.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">The first thing we must consider is our <b><i>FAITH</i></b>. The righteous one believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Book, the Angels, and the prophets. Turning our faces to the East and West is not righteousness, but righteousness is how we obey Allah’s commandment.
The second is our <b><i>ACTION</i></b>. Faith should be reflected in our deeds. Being virtuous entails more than just rituals and the Qur'an; we must also go out and affect people's lives. Being kind and merciful to others in the form of charity to those in need, orphans, relatives, and travelers are examples of righteous deeds.
Finally, there are our <b><i>MORALS</i></b>. A righteous person will never be a righteous person if he does not have decent morals. The Qur'an promotes morality in numerous verses, and even our Prophet Muhammad taught us to be moral. In the verse, Allah says that the righteous are the ones who keep his promise. We must be truthful to our own words since trust always begins within ourselves. People will respect our words if we do. One of the most essential things to remember is that we must be patient in the face of adversity and hardships in our lives. A righteous person understands how to deal with challenges and humble himself in front of God.
There are many of us who are striving to embark on a spiritual journey, and I just want you to know that I am very proud of you. We are doing this, no matter how tough it may be because we want to please Allah and be counted among the virtuous people who love Allah. Never lose hope because I am certain that with our sincerity, we will attain our goals In Shaa Allah.
Everyone is involved in their prayers, good deeds, and remembrance of Allah throughout the month of Ramadhan, which is wonderful news; nevertheless, we should not stop after Ramadhan; we should continue with our spiritual journey and have patience in our hearts. Let us benefit from the mercy of this month. I'm praying for all of us that He will make it easy for us In Shaa Allah.</p>
