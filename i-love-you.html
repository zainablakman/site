  <h2 class="title"> I Love You </h2>  
  
    <img src="https://zainablakman.github.io/site/img/blog6-1.jpg" alt="Poster" class="thumbnail">
  <p style="text-align:justify"> I always knew that love would come to find me someday.<br>
But never did I know that it would be you<br>
Who was headed on my way one day.<br>
You caught me off guard and took me by surprise<br>
But you simply captivated me, the same way you look into my eyes.</p>  
<p style="text-align:justify"> You are the perfect gift sent from above.<br>
I'll cherish you with the genuineness of my love,<br>
From the day I sought you till the end of my life<br>
Because you deserved my soul, as you brought my soul back into life.</p>  
  <p style="text-align:justify"> The day we tied our knot was the day you completed me.<br>
When I look at you walking down the aisle,<br>
I knew it was you whom Allah promised me.<br>
And I can't wait to build the life we've promised together.</p>   
  <p style="text-align:justify">  From when you laugh to when you're upset,<br>
I still love the little things you do.<br>
You comforted me on the days I don't know what to do.<br>
And you lightened up my days with the simple touch of your love.</p>  
  <p style="text-align:justify">Coming into this relationship has been hard at times,<br>
But having you throughout the way, we've made it through all the times.<br>
Sometimes I wonder if what we have is too good to be true,<br>
And I know we both deserved all of these after everything we've gone through.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I prayed to Allah that these feelings wouldn't last<br>
Even the world and the people are against us.<br>
Too scared to get my heart broken and scared of the thought of losing you,<br>
But in the end, I trust Him because we shall return to Him.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I may not know what tomorrow may bring,<br> 
For Allah is the only One Who knows.<br>
The one thing I do know is that you are my one and only,<br>
A treasure in my heart that I want to devote my whole life completely.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">But life is unpredictable,<br> 
Just like the time I lose you was unbelievable.<br> 
I know you fought for your life and our love,<br>
But in the end, you left me and you returned to Allah with love.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I cried not little but like an endless water flowing in a river.<br>
You clothe my soul with pains of our memories as a lover.<br>
You became the blood running in my veins that keeps me alive,<br>
But how can my soul lives if you're no longer alive?</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">When you said your last goodbye,<br>
I died a little bit inside.<br>
I know we're apart just for a while,<br>
But we will meet as lovers once in a while. </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">You are the half of my soul, but since you were gone,<br> 
No one replaces you in the core of my heart.<br>
This is the first time I've been truly happy,<br>
And I couldnâ€™t ask for anything more,<br>
Because it's an honor to know that I am yours, as you are mine.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I'll be waiting patiently for that day when we'll be together,<br>
That precious moment in time when I'll say:<br>
"It's you that I want to be with forever."<br>
But I know it will be a long journey that I need to travel.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Missing and loving you are in my realm,<br>
But I trust Allah that He'll bring us together in His beautiful time.<br>
Allah made everything beautiful and precious,<br>
Just as beautiful and precious as the day will be,<br>
When I look into your eyes and I say,<br>
"I LOVE YOU"</p>
